    <h1>Linked Data Checker</h1>
    <p class="static">This is proof of concept software that will check any JSON-LD embedded in web pages for conformance against a chosen schema. This instance is configured to check against a profile of <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and <a href="http://oerschema.org/">oerschema</a> such as might be used to describe learning materials.</p>
    <p class="static">To try this out and compare the results to other similar testing services, have a look at the demo file or navigate to <a href="/checker?">/checker?url=</a> and put the url of the page you want to check after the '?url='</p>
    <p class="static">For more information see our <a href="https://github.com/philbarker/OCXChecker/">github repository</a>.</p>
    <p class="static">Once again, this is proof of concept software. It is provided to illustrate what the checker may do. It is essentially pre-alpha in the development cycle; it changes frequently, and may or may not work on any given day. Do not use in a production environment. If you do want to make use of the software, contact the author via github.</p>
