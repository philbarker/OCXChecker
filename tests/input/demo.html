  <h1>Demo of Customizable LD checker</h1>
  <p>Embedded in this HTML is some JSON-LD metadata that uses oerschema and schema.org terms that could describe a lesson. Validating it in well known linked data checkers will raise some spurious errors and miss some real errors. Validating with the Customizable LD checker will validate against schema.org + oerschema, with a couple of additional requirements on the entities that must be present (there must be something related to a Course) and properties that must be provided (there must be a name and description).  These additional schemas and requirements are what is customizable.</p>
  <script>
    var url = window.location.href;
    var service = "http://ocxchecker.appspot.com/?url="
    document.write("<a href='",service,url,"'>Try with this doc.</a>");

  <h2>Google structured data testing tool</h2>
  <p>Perhaps the most widely used testing tool for structured data based on schema.org (the most widely used vocabulary). </p>
  <script>
    var url = window.location.href;
    var service = "https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool#url="
    document.write("<a href='",service,url,"'>Try with this doc.</a>");
  </script>
  <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDTT will complain about not knowing about terms from the oer: namespace (or other namespaces other than schema.org)</li>
      <li>SDTT will complain about absence of terms that Google needs for some of its services</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Google's rich results test</h2>
  <p>Still-in-beta update of the SDTT. Even more focussed on schema.org, Google search results and other Google services</p>
  <script>
    var url = window.location.href;
    var service = "https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url="
    document.write("<a href='",service,url,"'>Try with this doc.</a>");
  </script>
  <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Doesn't report on anything it doesn't understand, which in this case is everything.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Structured data validator</h2>
  <p>From the Russian search engine Yandex, but without any expectation that data will be schema.org or geared towards a specific product. Has a useful API for bulk tests.</p>
  <a href= "https://webmaster.yandex.com/tools/microtest/">Try it</a> (copy and paste URL of this doc)
  <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Passes anything that has a valid looking structure, in this case errors like "sod:description" instead of "sdo:description" do not get picked up.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Structured data linter</h2>
  <p>Probably the most flexible. Knows about some vocabularies other than schema.org but ignores errors from those that it does not know about. Open source, in Ruby.</p>
  <script>
    var url = window.location.href;
    var service = "http://linter.structured-data.org/?url="
    document.write("<a href='",service,url,"'>Try with this doc.</a>");
  </script>
  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Passes anything that has a valid looking structure, in this case errors like "sod:description" instead of "sdo:description" do not get picked up.</li>
  </ul>
