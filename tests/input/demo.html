  <h1>Demo of Customizable LD checker</h1>
  <p>Embedded in this HTML is some JSON-LD metadata that uses oerschema and schema.org terms that could describe a lesson. Validating it in well known linked data checkers will raise some spurious errors and miss some real errors.</p>
  <h2>Google structured data testing tool</h2>
  <p>Perhaps the most widely used testing tool for structured data based on schema.org (the most widely used vocabulary). </p>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>SDTT will complain about not knowing about terms from the oer: namespace</li>
      <li>SDTT will complain about absence of terms that Google needs for some of its services</li>
    </ul>
